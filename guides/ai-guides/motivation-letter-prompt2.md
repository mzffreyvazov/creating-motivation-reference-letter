In the application form, there are two input boxes: one for "Personal Statement" and the other one for " Relevant Knowledge/Training Skills".
- For the first one, it is written: "Please give a short statement that describes your academic interests, purpose, objectives and motivation in undertaking this postgraduate study. (max 3500 chars – approx. 500 words) -- This should include why you feel you are qualified to enter the programme and how you think it may affect your career prospects. If you are applying for a Masters programme and your chosen programme has more than one area of specialism or theme you should indicate here which area(s) you wish to specialise in."

You can look at sample winning motivation letters and motivation letter guides to get an idea on how to write one for me. Also you can see my own motivation letters that I have written for programs that I have applied in motivation-letters-muzeffer/ folder. These letters will help you know my preferred language style, sentence structures, etc. Most of those letters are submitted, and two of them got admitted (sheffield and leeds ones). 

Lets start with plan mode. I want you to propose me the structure of the letter. 

There is a section in the #file:uni-of-leeds-data-science.md file, named "Motivation Hooks". You can see specific and nice details about the program, that may find you to prepare the letter that also answers the questions they want in #sym:## 12) Motivation Letter Requirements by the University .

There is no specific word limit. I want it around one page -- approx. 500-700 words
