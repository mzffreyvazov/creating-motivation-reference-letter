## This is from a professor
When I write them for my students, I aim for four paragraphs:
1. how I know them, and what I am recommending them for.
2. items from their resume or academic background that I can share (dean's list, any jobs, etc). I emphasize how these items relate to our field. This would also include any internships, academic honors, volunteering, etc. If I could find it by Googling my student or it's on their resume above and beyond their degree, this information goes here.
3. personal connections to the student - specific assignments they submitted to me, projects we worked on together, and why I think they will actually be successful in the field. This is the longest section, and lets me really brag about the student and why they are actually excellent. Anyone could be on the dean's list, but this student did XYZ as well. If I supervised the student in their internship, worked on their honor's project, they were on a research team with me, or submitted really excellent work to my courses, I write about that here.
4. restatement of why I think they are a good applicant, with my contact info if they want to reach out to me.

## This is from another professor 
My general outline:
First paragraph (Intro)
- Introduction saying I recommend [full name] to [program] at [university].
- How long and in what capacity I know the student (taught in class, advised, was my TA, chaired thesis, etc.)
- Quick summary of attributes I think qualify the student.

Next section (classes they took with me)
- Brief description of course (survey, seminar, etc.)
- Overall assessment of their performance (not just the grade)
- Some examples of why they did well (some from an assignment, or exam performance, or class discussion ability, etc.)
- Repeat if more than one class

Next section (research experience)
- What projects the student was involved in
- Specifically what parts the student was involved in
- Quality of their work and level of supervision needed
- What are the outcomes of the research (presentations, publications, etc.)
- If the student presented work, I will describe the type venue and assess how they did

Next section (general attributes)
- Personal strengths
- How well they work with others
- How well they take instruction / feedback
- Comment on the students future plans and if they are moving toward them
- Comment on hardships they have overcome (work full time, first in family in college, etc.) or address a red flag if needed (why they did poor only one semester, etc.)
- Few more personal strengths (always end on positive stuff)
- Compare students to other students I have taught
- Give bottom line assessment where I again recommend the person for the program

In all cases, try to give some examples instead of just saying vague nice things.

For a student that only took a class from me, they get about 3 paragraphs (I warn them up front), the intro, class paragraph, and general paragraph. For someone that worked in my lab, these get divided into as many paragraphs as needed and is about 2 pages.

## This is from another teacher 

Your professor wants you to make a connection between what he observed or would know about you as a student and what this graduate program is looking for: Did you perform well in the class? Did you show enthusiasm for the material? Did you make frequent visits to his office to clarify information, discuss material, etc.? Did you receive feedback on a paper or project that indicated this professor was particularly impressed with your work or ideas? Does the program you are applying to build on the material from the class you took with this professor, so he can speak to your mastery of or enthusiasm for the material? Did you do any internships, volunteer work, hold office or membership in a relevant club/group, etc.? Think about why you are asking this specific professor to write the letter, what he knows or should have observed about you, and how this connects to the program you're applying.
