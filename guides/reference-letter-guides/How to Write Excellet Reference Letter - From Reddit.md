## The secret to having excellent letters of recommendation

I've seen a lot of posts from students on r/ApplyingToCollege and a lot of emails from my own students asking who should they ask to write letters of recommendation. I read apps for a top 10 university, and my recommendation is to ask for two letters of recommendation, one from a teacher in a STEM field and one from a teacher in the humanities. Ideally, pick a junior year teacher. Other options include asking a senior year teacher who taught you in a previous grade or has worked with you in some extracurricular activity, or a sophomore year teacher with whom you have an ongoing relationship (you TAed one of their classes, you work with them in an extracurricular activity, etc.). If you've had a prestigious internship, ask your advisor/professor if they're amenable to writing a letter of recommendation on your behalf, in addition to the two recs from teachers. Some schools will allow you to send 3 recs and even if they don't, you could follow up with a LOCI and attach that 3rd rec.

So what's the secret to having excellent letters of recommendation? Personalization! You cannot believe how many letters of rec I read that were blah, telling me nothing specific about the student, their personality, or their aspirations. Ideally, a teacher will also assess the student's ability compared to their peers (for example, "He is the single most driven student I have met in my 10 year career, and he is absolutely determined to accomplish his dreams of XYZ" or "She is the brightest math student I teach across all my 7 classes this year," etc.).

How do you get letters of recommendation like that? Give your teacher a letter/brag sheet/whatever you want to call it. Teachers have limited time to write your letter of rec; often, they will paraphrase or directly quote things you have written. This is an excellent opportunity for you to advance qualities that you think your dream universities would love to see within your application. Most students have control over everything in their application but letters of rec—with this exercise, you'll have some control over letters of rec, as well.

### Why I liked your class

Things to keep in mind: Be very specific into why you liked that particular teacher's class. Mention projects you liked, describe what you found fascinating about the subject or what you liked about the teacher's teaching style, and say something about yourself in the process. You might also want to incorporate your desired major and how it relates to this particular class.

Example: I really loved AP Literature because I have always been mesmerized by far off lands in literature. More so than just being transported to a different world when reading [book 1] or [book 2], however, I loved being transported into different perspectives. Taking a step back from literature, in general I am mesmerized by people—how they think, why they act the way they do, what causes them to make certain decisions over others, and so on. That’s one of the reasons why I want to major in Sociology in college, for I crave as much knowledge about other people as possible. In AP Literature, I satiated my thirst for all things related to sociology when I read [book], which gave me a glimpse into the inner workings of [group of people]. What I found so curious about the book, from a sociological standpoint, was ________. It really made me reflect upon my own circumstances and realize [something about myself]. Additionally, I really appreciated how you asked probing questions during class, such as [question]

### What I learned about myself during high school

Things to keep in mind: Be reflective about your transition from a freshman to a junior, both in an academic sense but also related to your personality, maturity, or preparation for college. What changed? What stayed the same? When was your character challenged? When did you try new things?

Example: I really developed my passion for music throughout high school. Before high school, I practiced the violin because my parents wanted me to play an instrument and forced me to sit in a chair for 2 hours each night to play the same songs over and over again. That obligation nearly broke me; by 8th grade, I had become completely dispassionate about music. At one point, I even considered breaking my bow just to avoid another day in front of my music stand. It wasn’t until the passing of my grandmother during my freshman year that I realized the love I had for music and developed a desire to play the violin for intrinsic reasons. That bow I so callously thought of breaking? It and my violin were passed down to me from my grandmother’s father—his prized possession that he carried with him when he immigrated to the United States. Before my grandmother passed, she looked at me and said how proud she was of me for carrying on her father’s tradition. When she said that, I felt as if her feeble hands had punch

### How I'm different from my peers

Things to keep in mind: Only include positive details. Don't say that you're antisocial and don't get along with anyone (even if that's true). Instead, spin that bit of info into a positive: "Although I'm more reserved than many of my peers, my quietude enables me to soak up knowledge and insight from every angle." You can talk about how you have a thirst for knowledge that is uncharacteristic of many students, how you have a really focused interest on XYZ, how you've had some really awesome research opportunity that isn't afforded to many high school students, or how your minority status has given you a new perspective on the world. Don't just include positive details about yourself—stay positive about your peers, too. Don't put them down. Don't say "while all my classmates are lazy, I'm really driven." Instead, say "While many kids are still figuring out their passions in high school, I'm already incredibly driven to do XYZ." Get the difference? All this will help your teacher to say "he/she is unlike any

### My hopes for college

Things to keep in mind: Don’t generically say you hope to go to college. Instead, be specific regarding what you’d like to study, what type of learning environment you seek, and possibly mention your list of universities to which you’re applying. While your teacher won’t likely write a personalized essay to each school, it’s a good idea to inform them of universities to which you’re applying so they can tailor their essay to the general environment of those universities.

### My three best qualities

Things to keep in mind: Don’t say hardworking, perfectionist, driven, or any other cliched statements that every high school student and his/her mother would use to describe themselves. Instead, Google “adjectives to describe yourself in an interview” and write down a list of every adjective that applies to you/your character. Once you’re done making that list, cross off the cliches and narrow your list to refreshing words that describe your character and help you stand out from others. A word like methodical, for example, could describe similar qualities as hardworking and perfectionist, but it’s a much less commonly used word and thus stands out more amongst the crowd. Don’t just list those three words, but give a short example of why you embody that adjective.

### My greatest accomplishments

Things to keep in mind: You can mention an award you won, a position for which you were elected in a club, a grade you worked hard to achieve, a character trait you developed, and many other things. Don’t feel that you haven’t had any accomplishments—of course you have. Maybe you and your softball team won an important match, you turned your C in algebra into a B after tons of studying, you befriended the oddball new kid, learned a new language, or you helped your little sister learn to play soccer despite her two left feet. Your accomplishment doesn’t have to be grandiose, but it does have to tell your teacher something about yourself that they might not know just from having you in class.

### Challenges I’ve faced

Things to keep in mind: If you’ve experienced any challenges whatsoever, feel free to add this section and describe them. If you haven’t experienced any challenges, you can omit this section. Challenges include moving schools, learning a new language after immigrating to a new country, coming out, overcoming a learning disability, losing a loved one, having to take on considerable responsibilities at home/in a family business, being homeless, dealing with your own or a loved one’s illness (both mental and/or physical), enduring abuse, struggling to get a good grade in a class, etc. Give your teacher context for any low grades you might have received, absences, etc., and specifically describe how you have overcome these issues or what you are currently doing to overcome these issues. This last part is crucial.

### Why I am grateful that you’ve agreed to write this letter of recommendation on my behalf

Things to keep in mind: Write a quick thank you at the end of your letter to your teacher, thanking them for the time they’ll spend penning your letter of recommendation. These things take a TON of time, so give your teacher some gratitude. Plus, maybe it’ll help them write nice things about you ;)
