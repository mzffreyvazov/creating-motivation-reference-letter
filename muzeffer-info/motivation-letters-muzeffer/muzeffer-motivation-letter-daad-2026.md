# Motivation Letter from Muzaffar Eyvazov

**October 31, 2025**

**Dear Members of the Selection Committee,**

During my recent internship at the Government House in Azerbaijan, I built the country’s first AI-powered legal query system. It is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application that allows everyone to query national legislation using natural language. As I developed this system from data processing through to the user interface, I believe achieved something ambitious. But this success revealed a fundamental problem right at the beginning. I found out that there is no open-source embedding model for Azerbaijani language that would do the work reliably. I had to rely on Google’s proprietary embedding model, which means relying on foreign infrastructure for sensitive government information. This experience made me realise that Azerbaijan, along with millions of speakers of underrepresented languages, lacks the foundational AI infrastructure and tools that speakers of major languages take for granted. This drives my decision to pursue a Master’s degree in Data Science and AI in Germany. I want to develop the core technologies that will enable my country to build its own sovereign, trustworthy AI systems and software.

I first started as a software engineer. Throughout my undergraduate studies at Azerbaijan State University of Economics, I focused on building full-stack applications. I just enjoyed creating working software from just ideas. In 2024, I was selected for the Advanced Computer Science Program organised by IDDA in partnership with Constructor University in Germany, focused on algorithms and data structures. This was my first real connection with German education, and the experience went beyond technical learning. I had conversations with German teachers about education systems, research culture, and their approach to problem-solving. These discussions planted something in me, a curiosity about bringing that systematic, research-driven approach back to Azerbaijan.

But the real turning point for me came in 2025 when I was selected for the Data Science Program organized by IDDA, StrategEast, and Sigma Software University. I was one of only 11 participants to complete this intensive program. This was the first time I rigorously practiced AI, data science and machine learning fundamentals. As I learned these skills, I realized that combining AI knowledge and capabilities with software engineering expertise would be invaluable for the future. I had the engineering discipline and skills knowledge to build reliable, scalable systems. Now I was also gaining the ability to make those systems intelligent. And I realized that combining these skills would make me an irreplaceable professional in today’s world. That’s when I decided I wanted to pursue a Master’s in AI and Data Science.

This decision was put into practice during my internship at 4SIM, where I built the country’s first working chatbot that would answer legal questions based on the true and authentic sources using RAG architecture. I designed the complete architecture: implementing retrieval algorithms, integrating large language models, optimizing performance, deployment of the backend service, and building a frontend that everyone could use. This was where my software engineering background met AI, where I needed both to make it work. But more importantly, this project opened my eyes to something bigger. RAG systems are relatively new, and there are so many open research questions: How do you improve retrieval quality and speed? How is the system affected if there are thousands of documents? What about the domain? How do you build better embedding models? How do you make these systems work for low-resource languages? When I searched for an open-source embedding model for Azerbaijani, I found nothing that could reliably work. Therefore, I had to rely on Google’s proprietary embeddings, which would create dependencies on foreign infrastructure for sensitive government data, but the biggest problem was that the data would be used for training by the provider, which is considered a huge problem for corporations and organizations that hold private data. This wasn’t also just about one missing model. It revealed that Azerbaijan, along with millions of speakers of underrepresented languages, lacks foundational AI infrastructure. I realized my contribution shouldn’t be just building applications with inadequate tools, it should be developing the core technologies that enable others to build sovereign, reliable and powerful AI systems.

Beyond the technical challenges, I’m deeply motivated by helping my community. Close friends often tell me my ideas and approaches to problems were pretty unique, and I should share them. This led me to create a blog where I share my knowledge and experiences on any topic that interest me. For instance, when I self-studied for IELTS and achieved 8.0, many friends were skeptical it was possible without expensive courses. After proving it could be done with the right strategy and dedication, I wrote a detailed blog post sharing everything I learned about the preparation process. Seeing others benefit from my experience brings me genuine happiness. It is the same drive that fuels my desire to develop open-source AI tools and infrastructures. I want to create resources that empower engineers, developers and organizations in Azerbaijan and other underrepresented language communities, just as I’ve tried to help my friends through shared knowledge.

I believe that Germany is where I need to be to pursue this vision. German universities are home to leading research groups in information retrieval, natural language processing, exactly the areas, I believe, I need to master. Germany’s commitment to open-source software aligns with my goal of creating freely available AI tools for underrepresented languages. And the timing also matters too: Azerbaijan recently approved its ”Artificial Intelligence Strategy” covering 2025-2028. I want to be a bridge between German AI research excellence and Azerbaijan’s growing technology sector, bringing cutting-edge methodologies, research and technologies back to my homeland, and contribute to this national initiative.

Technische Universität Braunschweig’s Master’s program in Data Science with a focus on Data Science in Applications - Engineering is my strongest choice. The program offers ”Information Retrieval and Web Search Engines” and ”Knowledge-Based Systems and Deductive Databases”, which are exactly what I need to excel in this area and are directly relevant to RAG systems and the research questions I want to dive deep into. The Engineering application focus shows how the program connects theoretical AI with practical systems, which is exactly the combination I need.

The University of Göttingen’s Master’s program in Applied Data Science with a focus on Digital Humanities offers comprehensive NLP training. ”Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing” and ”Computational Semantics and Discourse Processing” would give me deep insights into language understanding—crucial for building systems that go beyond pattern matching. The Industry Internship connects research with practical deployment, something I value after my own internship experience. I have a particular interest in the GIPPLab by Prof. Bela Gipp whose one of focuse areas is on Natural Language Processing, information retrieval, and large-scale text analysis. I believe that their research and work would closel fit my goal of developing multilingual and knowledge-based AI systems.

FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg’s Master’s in Artificial Intelligence offers comprehensive foundations with ”Speech and Language Processing” and two projects providing substantial hands-on research time. Carl von Ossietzky University of Oldenburg’s Data Science and Machine Learning program emphasizes trustworthy and mathematically grounded ML through ”Trustworthy Machine Learning” in their course module and a Group Project for extended research. Trier University’s Data Science program focuses on Data and Knowledge Systems with ”Digital Libraries and Foundations of Information Retrieval” and ”Semantic Information Systems”, directly supporting intelligent search systems.

My goal is to become a professional AI engineer who can lead the development of advanced AI systems in Azerbaijan. The country’s technology sector is evolving rapidly, and there’s urgent need for engineers who combine theoretical understanding with practical systems expertise, particularly in areas like RAG systems, which can be applied to almost anything. I want to contribute to Azerbaijan’s AI Strategy 2025-2028 by building robust, powerful systems for government and private sector applications, leading research and development teams, and helping establish the technical infrastructure that will allow my country to develop its own AI capabilities. The work I envision, creating open-source tools for Azerbaijani language processing, optimizing retrieval systems for local applications, building frameworks that organizations can deploy, which requires the combination of theoretical depth and practical systems thinking that a German Master’s program provides.

Thank you for considering my application. Studying in Germany with DAAD support would enable me to solve the challenges I encountered during my work, which is the lack of AI infrastructure for underrepresented languages, and I strongly believe that I can make significant transformations and provide practical solutions. I’m eager to bring my software engineering background and AI experience to Germany’s research community, and I’m confident this will enable me to serve as a bridge between German research excellence and Azerbaijan’s technological development.
