# Personal Statement, University of Edinburgh MSc Artificial Intelligence

I am a final-year Computer Science student whose path toward AI began unexpectedly. During my first university years, I focused on software engineering. I studied programming, data structures, and system design. Then I discovered a Data Science Program by IDDA, StrategEast, and Sigma Software University. I applied, was selected, and during the programme I realised that data science and AI were where I wanted to direct my career. I was recognised as a Top 11 performer and secured an AI Engineer internship at 4SİM, Azerbaijan's Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution. There, I built a RAG-based legal chatbot for e-qanun.az, the government's legal platform. The project required both my software engineering and AI skills, and it succeeded, but it also exposed a critical gap: no open-source embedding model exists for the Azerbaijani language, so I had to rely on proprietary foreign infrastructure for sensitive government data. This was not a limitation I could work around. It revealed that advancing AI for underrepresented languages requires foundational research, not just application skills. That realisation drives my pursuit of the MSc in Artificial Intelligence at Edinburgh.

Edinburgh is uniquely positioned to provide this foundation. As the UK's longest-established AI centre, ranked first for Computer Science research power in REF 2021, it offers an environment where foundational AI research is actively advanced. I intend to specialise in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. Modules such as Natural Language Understanding, Generation, and Machine Translation, Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition, and Probabilistic Modelling and Reasoning address the exact gaps my internship revealed. The Institute for Language, Cognition and Computation aligns with my interest in language AI, while the Generative AI Laboratory connects to my hands-on experience building generative AI applications. With over a hundred elective courses spanning AI, cognitive science, and informatics, I can design a pathway that bridges NLP theory and applied systems. Edinburgh's partnerships with Google DeepMind, OpenAI, and Microsoft, alongside Edinburgh Innovations' commercialisation support, create a research-to-impact pipeline I find compelling.

What draws me most is the opportunity to pursue independent research within a world-class environment, potentially on NLP for low-resource languages or domain-specific retrieval-augmented generation. My experience building RAG systems and fine-tuning a large language model for an IELTS Writing Evaluator has given me a foundation in experiment design and iterative model evaluation. Edinburgh's research depth and its reputation as a pathway into doctoral study make it the ideal place to explore whether a dedicated research career is the right path forward.

Whether I continue into research or industry, my goal is the same: advancing AI capabilities for Azerbaijan and underrepresented language communities. Azerbaijan's AI Strategy 2025–2028 has created demand for professionals who can develop foundational AI tools, not merely deploy existing ones. I aim to lead the development of open-source NLP infrastructure, including embedding models, retrieval systems, and language tools, free from dependence on proprietary foreign platforms. The MSc at Edinburgh would give me the rigorous foundation to make that contribution meaningful.
