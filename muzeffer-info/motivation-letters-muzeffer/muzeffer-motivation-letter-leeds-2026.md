# Motivation Letter — University of Leeds MSc Data Science and Analytics

I am a final-year Computer Science student, expected to graduate in 2026. Throughout my studies, I have built a strong foundation in software engineering, programming, data structures and algorithms, and database management. Alongside my degree, I actively sought extracurricular programs to deepen my skills: I participated in an Advanced Computer Science Program organised by IDDA in partnership with Constructor University Germany, which strengthened my algorithmic thinking. I then completed an intensive Data Science Program by IDDA, StrategEast, and Sigma Software University, where I was recognised as a Top 11 performer and earned the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Science Professional certification. These experiences convinced me that combining AI capabilities with software engineering expertise would be invaluable for the future. I had the engineering discipline to build reliable, scalable systems. Now I was also gaining the ability to make those systems intelligent. That is when I decided I wanted to pursue a Master's in Data Science.

This conviction was strengthened during my AI Engineer internship at 4SİM, Azerbaijan's Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution, from July to October 2025. There, I built a RAG-based legal chatbot for e-qanun.az, the government's legal information platform, handling document processing and deploying a full-stack application. I also developed an automated system for generating PDF dashboards from CSV data and created an AI-powered presentation slide generator. This experience was quite insightful because it allowed me to apply both my AI and software engineering skills together. It solidified my vision that software engineering combined with expertise in data science and AI is an invaluable skill for the future.

The MSc Data Science and Analytics at Leeds appeals to me because of two distinctive features. First, the programme's interdisciplinary structure draws expertise from four schools (Mathematics, Computer Science, Geography, and Business), which would enable me to understand the broad applications of data science and gain knowledge from these disciplines. This interdisciplinary approach would help me decide where I want to focus my expertise in the future. Second, the programme's connection to the Leeds Institute for Data Analytics and the Alan Turing Institute offers the research environment I am seeking. LIDA's focus on industry and government data projects aligns directly with my experience building AI systems for government platforms. Through this programme, I expect to acquire advanced skills in machine learning, statistical methods, and research methodology. Modules such as Machine Learning, Statistical Learning, and Deep Learning would provide the theoretical depth I need to complement my practical experience.

After completing the programme, I plan to return to Azerbaijan and contribute to my country's growing technology sector. Azerbaijan recently approved its Artificial Intelligence Strategy covering 2025-2028, and there is increasing demand for professionals who combine theoretical understanding with practical systems expertise. My goal is to become a data scientist who can lead the development of advanced AI systems for government and private sector applications. The MSc at Leeds would provide me with the formal academic foundation to make a meaningful contribution to this developing field in my home country.
