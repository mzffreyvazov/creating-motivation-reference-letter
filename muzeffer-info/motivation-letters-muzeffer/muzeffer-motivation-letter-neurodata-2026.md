# Motivation Letter — Erasmus Mundus NeuroData Programme

I have always been fascinated by how the brain works. When I was preparing for my university entrance exams, I couldn't afford multiple tutors, so I decided to take on the challenge of studying entirely on my own (which was an extremely rare thing here). In the end, I was happy with this decision because it led me down an interesting path: to learn effectively, I needed to understand how learning itself works. I started reading popular neuroscience books, watching videos about memory and cognition, and experimenting with study techniques based on what I discovered. This curiosity has always stayed with me afterwards: Recently, I read "How People Learn" by Nick Shackleton-Jones, which resonated deeply with my own observations of how I remember things and process information. The book challenged the conventional separation of rational and emotional thinking, suggesting our brain might operate primarily through emotions, and it explained phenomena that current theories struggle to address holistically. I believe there are significant untapped research areas here. While reading, I started wondering whether these insights could inspire novel AI architectures. So in essence, my passion comes from such personal experiences. And deep down, I have always wanted to combine my passion for programming with my fascination for the brain, and NeuroData is the perfect programme to pursue this.

I believe that my academic and professional background has prepared me well for this interdisciplinary journey. Alongside my Computer Science degree, I actively sought extracurricular programs to deepen my skills. I participated in an Advanced Computer Science Program organised by IDDA in partnership with Constructor University (Germany), which strengthened my algorithmic thinking. I then completed an intensive Data Science Program by IDDA, StrategEast, and Sigma Software University, where I was recognised as a Top 11 performer and earned the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Science Professional certification. During my internship at 4SİM, Azerbaijan's Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution, I built RAG-based AI systems for government platforms, gaining hands-on experience with machine learning pipelines and data processing. My Python proficiency and ML foundations position me well for the data science aspects of NeuroData, while I recognise that neuroscience represents my knowledge gap, exactly what the programme's Year 1 curriculum is designed to address.

What attracts me most to NeuroData is its intentional interdisciplinary design. The research internship at Gonda Brain Research Center offers integration into active laboratories from the first year, and the Summer School's combination of experimental design and hardware-software training fills a critical gap in my purely computational background. For Year 2, I have selected the Systems Neuroscience track at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. This track aligns with my aspiration to pursue a PhD after completing my master's. I am drawn to working at the intersection of genetics, molecular biology, psychology, physiology, and computational methods. The connections to Amsterdam UMC and CNCR provide the top-tier research environment I seek.

My career vision also extends beyond personal growth. Azerbaijan is actively building AI partnerships with leading nations, most notably a recent memorandum on artificial intelligence cooperation with Israel. Studying Year 1 at Bar-Ilan University positions me uniquely to bridge Israeli neurotechnology innovation with my country's emerging AI ecosystem. I aim to become a researcher and professional who can contribute brain-data science expertise to Azerbaijan's development. 

I am confident that my data science skills, demonstrated through certifications and applied projects, combined with my genuine,  deep curiosity in neuroscience, make me a strong candidate for NeuroData. I am ready to contribute to the programme's interdisciplinary community while gaining the neuroscience foundations that will shape my research career.
