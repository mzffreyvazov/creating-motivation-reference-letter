# Motivation Letter — Erasmus Mundus NeuroData Programme

I have always been fascinated by how the brain works. When I was preparing for my university entrance exams, I couldn't afford multiple tutors, so I decided to take on the challenge of studying entirely on my own. In the end, I was thankful for this decision because it led me down an interesting path: to learn effectively, I needed to understand how learning itself works. I started researching memory and cognition, and experimenting with study techniques. This curiosity has always stayed with me: Recently, I read "How People Learn" by Nick Shackleton-Jones, which resonated deeply with my own observations of how I remember things and process information. The book challenged the conventional separation of rational and emotional thinking, suggesting our brain might operate primarily through emotions, explaining phenomena that current theories struggle to address. I believe there are significant untapped research areas here, and I wondered whether these insights could inspire novel AI architectures. Deep down, I have always wanted to combine my passion for programming with my fascination for the brain, and NeuroData is the perfect programme to pursue this.

I believe my academic and professional background has prepared me for this interdisciplinary journey. Alongside my Computer Science degree, I actively sought extracurricular programs: I participated in an Advanced Computer Science Program organised by IDDA and Constructor University, which strengthened my algorithmic thinking. I then completed an intensive Data Science Program by IDDA, StrategEast, and Sigma Software University, where I was a Top 11 performer and earned the OCI Data Science Professional certification. During my internship at 4SİM, Azerbaijan's Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution, I built RAG-based AI systems for government platforms. My Python proficiency and ML foundations position me well for NeuroData's data science aspects, while neuroscience represents my knowledge gap, exactly what Year 1 is designed to address.

What attracts me most to NeuroData is its intentional interdisciplinary design. The research internship at Gonda Brain Research Centre offers integration into active laboratories from the first year, and the Summer School's combination of experimental design and hardware-software training fills a critical gap in my purely computational background. For Year 2, I have selected the Systems Neuroscience track in Amsterdam. This track aligns with my aspiration to pursue a PhD after completing my master's. I am drawn to working at the intersection of genetics, molecular biology, psychology, physiology, and computational methods. The connections to Amsterdam UMC and CNCR provide the top-tier research environment I seek.

My career vision extends beyond personal growth. Azerbaijan recently signed an AI cooperation memorandum with Israel, and studying Year 1 at Bar-Ilan positions me to bridge Israeli neurotechnology innovation with my country's emerging ecosystem. I aim to become a researcher who can contribute brain-data science expertise to Azerbaijan's development.

I am confident that my data science skills, combined with my genuine curiosity about biological intelligence, make me a strong candidate for NeuroData. I am ready to contribute to the programme's interdisciplinary community while gaining the neuroscience foundations for my career.
