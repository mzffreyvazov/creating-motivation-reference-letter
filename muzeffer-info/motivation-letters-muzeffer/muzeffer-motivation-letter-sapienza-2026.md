# Motivation Letter — Sapienza University MSc Data Science

I am a final-year Computer Science student at Azerbaijan State University of Economics, expected to graduate in 2026. Throughout my studies, I have built a strong foundation in programming, data structures, and database management. These experiences gave me solid technical grounding, but it was my exposure to data science that truly shaped my academic and career direction.

My interest in data science developed through formal training programs. I participated in an Advanced Computer Science Program with Constructor University Germany, then completed an intensive Data Science Program where I was recognised as a Top 11 performer and earned the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Science Professional certification. This conviction was strengthened during my internship at 4SİM, Azerbaijan's Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution, where I built RAG-based AI systems for government platforms.

The MSc Data Science at Sapienza appeals to me because of its unique interdisciplinary structure, combining Computer Science, Statistics, and Engineering departments. The Department of Computer Science's recognition as Italy's top-ranked department signals a research environment with leading faculty. I am particularly drawn to the hands-on laboratory components, which offers an opportunity to work on an original project with real-world relevance.

After completing the programme, I plan to return to Azerbaijan and contribute to data-driven initiatives in my country's growing tech ecosystem. Sapienza would provide me with the rigorous academic foundation to make that contribution meaningful.
