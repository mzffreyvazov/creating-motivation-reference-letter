**1 - How does the applicant stand out in academic terms and how would you assess his/her potential?**
During my lectures and seminars in Analytic Geometry and Numerical Methods, Muzeffer consistently demonstrated exceptional analytical thinking and problem-solving ability. He was one of the most diligent and curious students in both classes, always eager to go beyond standard requirements. In my Numerical Methods course, especially, he regularly implemented algorithms and created visualizations and mathematical animations to deepen understanding of challenging concepts. His ability to connect theory with computational practice, along with his intrinsic motivation to explore beyond the curriculum, makes him one of the top 5% of students I have interacted with. I believe he definitely possesses the intellectual and personal potential required for rigorous graduate study and research in data science and/or artificial intelligence.

**2 - How does the applicant stand out in personal terms and how would you assess his/her potential?**
Muzeffer is a very self-motivated and curious student who learns with genuine enthusiasm. He often explores new tools and programming methods on his own to better understand abstract ideas and make them easier to visualize. From our conversations, I also learned that he prepared for university independently, taught himself programming, and achieved an outstanding IELTS score through self-study. He even maintains his own blog where he shares his thoughts and knowledge on technical subjects and other topics that interest him. These achievements reflect not only his strong discipline and determination but also his willingness to share what he learns and contribute to others' understanding. His perseverance, openness to learning, and sense of responsibility show a level of maturity, which is rare among students. I believe his independence, motivation, and resilience will allow him to excel in demanding academic environments and to make the most of his graduate studies abroad.

**3 - How would you assess the preparation, feasibility, relevance and schedule of the project in question?**
Based on my experience with Muzeffer and my knowledge of his academic and professional work, I can say that he has prepared very carefully for his Master's studies. He has a genuine interest in natural language processing and retrieval-augmented systems, which connects well with his solid background in mathematics, programming, and numerical reasoning. The direction he has chosen is realistic, meaningful, and well thought out. From our conversations and what we talked about his goals, I can say that he a clear purpose in his academic goals and he also has a structured plan, which shows that he understands how his Master's studies will support both his future research and professional development.

**4 - Of what significance is the aspired scholarship to the applicant's academic and professional career and/or to his/her home institution?**
Receiving the DAAD scholarship would be a transformative opportunity for Muzeffer. It would allow him to pursue a research-oriented Master's degree in Germany and continue developing his skills in artificial intelligence and data science. From our conversations, I know that he is especially interested in improving open-source resources for the Azerbaijani language, for example by creating better models for text understanding and retrieval. He explained that such work could help companies and organizations in Azerbaijan use their own data securely without relying on third-party providers, since at present there are no reliable local models available. I believe this is a meaningful and practical goal that reflects his sense of responsibility and his wish to make advanced technology more accessible in his country. I am confident that he will use this opportunity to share knowledge and build lasting academic connections between Germany and Azerbaijan.

**5 - Additional information that could be of importance to the scholarship award decision:**
Beyond his coursework, Muzeffer showed genuine desire for learning and often went beyond what was expected. He volunteered to help me with my upcoming textbook in Numerical Methods by developing programming implementations and algorithmic examples in modern programming languages, which he completed thoughtfully and with very little supervision. His curiosity and dedication were evident in the way he used modern computational tools and visualizations to explore the material more deeply. This independent and research-minded attitude is what truly sets him apart and, in my view, makes him very well suited for a research-oriented academic environment.

**To sum up, my overall assessment is:**
In summary, Muzeffer Eyvazov is one of the most talented, disciplined, and motivated students I have taught. He combines a strong analytical mind with creativity, independence, and a deep interest in continuous learning. His ability to study complex subjects on his own, his strong command of programming, and his outstanding communication skills make him stand out both academically and personally. He approaches every challenge with curiosity and persistence, and he shows a clear sense of purpose in his academic and professional goals.

I am confident that Muzeffer will make excellent use of the opportunities provided by the DAAD Scholarship. His independence, work ethic, and sense of purpose will allow him to succeed in any demanding academic environment. I give him my highest and most sincere recommendation for this scholarship, as I am certain he will represent both his university and his country with distinction.
