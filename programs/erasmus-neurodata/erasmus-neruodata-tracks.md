## Strategic Ranking Advice

### Remember:
✅ You rank **3 universities** in order of preference  
✅ Committee considers preferences but **does NOT guarantee** first choice  
✅ They aim to "divide applicants across all tracks homogenously"  
✅ You CAN request track change during Year 1 (Administrative Board decides)

### Recommended Approach:

**Option 1: If You Have Clear #1 Choice**
1. List your top choice first
2. Include two others that ALSO genuinely support your goals (not just fillers)
3. In motivation letter, briefly explain why top choice fits best BUT also why alternatives would work

**Example:**
> "The Biomedical Engineering track at IST Lisbon is my first choice because [reasons], but I would also thrive in the Systems Neuroscience track at VU Amsterdam, as [reasons], and the Neuroimaging track at Jyväskylä would provide [reasons]."

**Option 2: If You're Genuinely Torn Between Two**
1. List both as #1 and #2
2. Third choice should still be defensible
3. In motivation letter, explain what excites you about both top choices

**Option 3: Strategic Balancing**
Consider which tracks might be:
- **More popular** (Amsterdam likely has highest demand due to reputation/city; Jyväskylä might have less competition)
- **Better fit for your background** (engineering students → Lisbon; psychology → Padua)
- **Aligned with committee's distribution goals**

### Red Flags to Avoid:

❌ **Don't:** List three tracks that have nothing in common or contradict each other  
→ Makes you seem unfocused or like you haven't researched

❌ **Don't:** Only express enthusiasm for #1 choice and dismiss others  
→ If you don't get #1, committee may question your commitment

❌ **Don't:** Choose based solely on city/lifestyle without academic rationale  
→ Committee can tell; academic fit must be primary justification

✅ **Do:** Show you've researched all three choices thoroughly  
✅ **Do:** Connect each choice to specific aspects of your background and goals  
✅ **Do:** Be honest about your interests while showing flexibility
