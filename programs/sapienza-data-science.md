## 10) Risks, Ambiguities, and To-Confirm Checklist

### Ambiguities identified:

1. **No formal specialization tracks mentioned**: Research indicates program does not have named "tracks" or "concentrations" despite inquiry about this. Students customize through elective selection rather than pre-defined paths. **Action**: Confirm with admissions if any informal groupings exist.

2. **Course catalogue variability**: Most recent detailed course list found is 2021-2022; 2024-2025 information sparse. Electives may have changed. **Action**: Check latest course catalogue at [Course Catalogue](https://corsidilaurea.uniroma1.it/en/course/2024/32344/home) or contact program.

3. **Scholarship deadline ambiguity**: DSU scholarships mention "May-July" application window but no exact 2026 dates. International Post-Degree Scholarship shows April 2025 deadline but 2026-2027 cycle unclear. **Action**: Check DSU website and Sapienza scholarships page in March-April 2026.

4. **Career outcome statistics**: €65,000 median salary cited but source unclear; official placement stats not found. **Action**: Request employability reports from program or careers office.

5. **Program code confusion**: Multiple course codes referenced (33519 for older program, 32344 for renewed program under LM-DATA class). **Action**: Verify correct code for 2026-2027 application on course catalogue.

6. **Housing availability**: Sapienza does NOT provide own student residences despite some sources suggesting otherwise. Relies on partner facilities. **Action**: Start housing search early; use official Sapienza housing mediation service.

7. **Assessment fee timing**: €10 fee required at application but process details unclear. **Action**: Confirm when to pay during Infostud registration process.

8. **English interview**: Unclear if all students without certificate must interview or if threshold exists. **Action**: Obtain B2 certificate if possible to avoid uncertainty.

### Conflicting information:

- **Tuition figures vary**: €2,924/year most commonly cited, but one source mentions €634/year annual fee, another mentions flat €2,821 for certain programs. **Likely explanation**: €2,924 is standard international rate; lower figures may be income-adjusted or for different programs.

- **Application deadline dates**: Pre-selection deadlines are clear for 2026-2027, but some secondary sources cite different dates (likely for 2025-2026 or outdated). **Trust**: Official Sapienza admissions page dated Dec 2025.

### Critical to-confirm items:

☐ **Exact course code** for MSc Data Science 2026-2027 application (likely 32344)  
☐ **Current elective offerings** for 2026-2027 academic year  
☐ **Scholarship application deadlines** for 2026 intake (especially DSU)  
☐ **Housing arrangements** – start early, no guaranteed university housing  
☐ **Visa processing timeline** for non-EU students post-acceptance  
☐ **English proficiency requirements** – confirm if B2 certificate sufficient or interview needed  
☐ **References format and submission** – check if electronic or paper  
☐ **Document legalization requirements** – Italian consulate procedures vary by country  
☐ **Career services offerings** – request information on job placement support  
☐ **Research group opportunities** – which faculty accepting MSc thesis students for specific topics

### Red flags / concerns:

- **No program-specific website**: Old datascience.i3s.uniroma1.it site not updated ("has been not updated anymore"); relies on central course catalogue. Makes finding current information difficult.

- **Limited 2024-2025 information**: Most detailed information from 2021-2022 courses; uncertain how much curriculum has changed under new LM-DATA class system.

- **Generic career data**: Most sources provide generic "data scientist, ML engineer" roles without Sapienza-specific placement data or employer lists.
