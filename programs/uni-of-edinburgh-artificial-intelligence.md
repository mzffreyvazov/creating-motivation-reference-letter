## 10) Risks, Ambiguities, and To-Confirm Checklist

### Items requiring confirmation/monitoring:

1. **2026-27 Tuition Fees**: Not yet published; using 2025-26 (£40,900) as reference. Official 2026-27 fees expected October 2025.
   - **Action**: Check [Tuition Fees Page](https://registryservices.ed.ac.uk/tuition-fees/find/postgraduate-taught) in October 2025.

2. **Course Availability for 2026-27**: Current information based on 2024-25 handbook. While core structure stable, specific electives may change.
   - **Action**: Verify [2025-26 Handbook](https://informatics.ed.ac.uk/taught-students/msc-students/taught-msc-handbook-202526) when published.

3. **Competitive Nature of Admissions**: "Typical offer normally requires UK First Class" — but minimum is 2:1. Unclear what proportion of admitted students have First vs. 2:1.
   - **Action**: Assess competitiveness realistically; consider strengthening application through research experience, strong statement, excellent references.

4. **Scholarship Deadlines Variance**: Different scholarships have different deadlines (India Merit automatic; GREAT 1 May; Spärck separate process).
   - **Action**: Create scholarship application timeline; monitor each scholarship page for updates.

5. **Prerequisite Evaluation**: Mathematics and programming prerequisites clearly stated, but "equivalent" evaluation for non-standard backgrounds unclear.
   - **Action**: If background non-standard, contact admissions (studywithus@hw.ac.uk or programme contact) to confirm eligibility before applying.

6. **Track/Specialization Options**: No formal tracks mentioned, though topic groupings (ML, NLP, Vision/Robotics, Cognitive Science) exist.
   - **Action**: Confirmed there are **no fixed specialization tracks** — students self-design pathways through course selection. This is a feature, not a bug.

7. **Part-time Study Flexibility**: Part-time option exists but requires "flexibility during semesters" due to irregular course scheduling.
   - **Action**: If considering part-time, confirm whether schedule compatible with other commitments.

8. **Project Availability**: Some topics may be "oversubscribed" at project selection time.
   - **Action**: Programme recommends taking courses from 2+ AI topics to ensure project flexibility; noted as good practice.

9. **No Explicit GRE Requirement**: Not mentioned, likely not required, but worth confirming.
   - **Action**: Confirmed no GRE requirement for this programme.

10. **Living Costs Range**: Wide range (£1,167-£2,330/month) reflects accommodation choice variation.
    - **Action**: Budget planning should use higher end for conservative estimate; explore University accommodation options early.

### Conflicting or Unclear Information:

- **Tuition fee figures**: Some third-party sites cite £45,410 (2026-27 estimate), others £40,900 (2025-26 confirmed). **Resolution**: Use official University sources only; expect ~£40,900-£45,000 range.

- **Application deadline enforcement**: "Applications will not be accepted after the deadline" vs. descriptions of rolling admissions for "outstanding candidates."
  - **Resolution**: Treat 31 March 2026 as hard deadline; early/rolling offers are exception, not rule.

### No Major Red Flags Identified
Programme well-documented with consistent information across official sources. Strong reputation, clear requirements, established track record.
