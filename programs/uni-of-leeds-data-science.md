## 10) Risks, Ambiguities, and To-Confirm Checklist

### Risks/Ambiguities:

1. **Specialization pathways not formally defined:**  
   - The program describes "pathways" in healthcare, business, GIS, etc., but these aren't official tracks. It's module-based customization. **Implication:** You have flexibility but need to self-design your pathway—no formal certificate of specialization.

2. **Tuition fee increase trend:**  
   - International fee increased £500 from 2025/26 to 2026/27 (£33,750 → £34,250). **Risk:** Further increases possible; budget conservatively.

3. **Accountancy/finance degrees explicitly excluded:**  
   - If your background includes significant accountancy/finance coursework, confirm eligibility with admissions team. Gray area for "business with some finance" degrees.

4. **Module availability may vary year-to-year:**  
   - Course materials state "modules may change from time to time." **Action:** After admission, confirm specific modules you're targeting are running in 2026/27.

5. **Scholarship competitiveness unclear:**  
   - While up to 500 International Excellence Scholarships are available university-wide, it's unclear how many are allocated to this specific MSc. **Action:** Apply early; don't rely on scholarship for funding decision.

6. **Virtual work experience details vague:**  
   - 8-week program described but partner companies, selection process, and exact structure unclear. **Action:** Request details from program office about typical placements and logistics.

7. **No formal AI/ML track despite strong research presence:**  
   - Program has deep AI/ML faculty and research, but no dedicated AI specialization (unlike "Advanced Computer Science - AI" track). If AI is primary goal, consider if elective flexibility suffices or if dedicated AI MSc is better fit.

8. **Graduate outcomes data not program-specific:**  
   - Employment stats cited are university-wide or from similar programs (Business Analytics). **Action:** Request Data Science and Analytics-specific placement data from admissions.

### To-Confirm Checklist:

- [ ] **Confirm specific modules** available for 2026/27 intake (especially advanced electives)
- [ ] **Clarify scholarship allocation** for Data Science and Analytics MSc specifically
- [ ] **Request details** on virtual work experience partners, sectors, and selection process
- [ ] **Verify international equivalency** of your specific undergraduate institution's grading scale
- [ ] **Ask about LIDA project opportunities** for MSc students (dissertation co-supervision availability)
- [ ] **Confirm language test** timing requirements (how recent must IELTS/TOEFL be?)
- [ ] **Check reference requirements** (number needed, academic vs professional preferences)
- [ ] **Inquire about accommodation** options and application process for September 2026
- [ ] **Verify visa timeline** from offer to program start (allow 3+ months)
- [ ] **Ask about AI Programme** involvement opportunities for MSc students (seminars, workshops)
