### Program Overview
The MSc in Data Science at the University of Sheffield is offered by the School of Information, Journalism and Communication within the Faculty of Social Sciences. This program equips students with the skills to analyze and utilize data in organizational and societal contexts, addressing challenges in data-driven decision-making. It covers theoretical foundations and practical applications, including ethical data extraction, handling structured and unstructured data, data analysis, visualization, mining, and tools such as R, Python, SPSS, Weka, and Tableau/Spotfire. The curriculum emphasizes data principles, supporting infrastructures, and real-world applications through hands-on projects and a dissertation. The program is CILIP-accredited (by the UK's library and information association) and ranked number one worldwide for library and information management (QS World University Rankings by subject 2025). It prepares graduates for roles like Data Scientist, Analyst, or Machine Learning Engineer in sectors such as consulting, finance, government, and tech (e.g., at Deloitte, Huawei, HMRC). Teaching combines lectures, seminars, tutorials, group work, lab sessions, and independent study, with assessments via essays, reports, presentations, tests, group projects, and a 10-15,000-word dissertation. Opportunities include industry-linked projects and collaborations for real-life experience.
