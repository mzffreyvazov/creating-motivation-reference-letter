# Motivation Letter 3: Ruslan Aliyev

**Dear Selection Committee Members,**

I am writing to express my sincere interest in applying for the DAAD scholarship to pursue a Master’s program that aligns with my goal of making education more inclusive and supportive for all learners. Growing up in a rural area of Azerbaijan, opportunities were limited, and my only way to pursue higher education was through sheer dedication to my studies. Earning the Azerbaijan Government Merit-Based Scholarship was my first step toward transforming my future. However, as a member of the LGBTQI+ community, I have faced additional barriers, especially in the job market. These experiences opened my eyes to the deep-seated inequalities in our education system, which often favour one major group—heteronormative, patriarchal society—while failing to accommodate diverse identities and learning strategies. This realisation has inspired my life’s mission: to work on myself and contribute to reshaping the educational system to make it more inclusive and supportive of all learners, regardless of their background or identity.

My journey into education began with a simple yet profound goal: to help students succeed, just as I had. However, it didn’t take long for me to recognize the systemic issues that prevent students from truly thriving, especially those from marginalised communities. During my time as an English language instructor and curriculum designer, I became increasingly aware of how the rigid structure of our education system leaves little room for personalised learning approaches. This became particularly evident when I began working with underrepresented groups, including my work at Salaam Cinema, where I created a safe space for the LGBTQI+ community to learn English in a welcoming environment. This experience fueled my desire to push for broader systemic change.

In seeking a master’s program that would allow me to tackle these challenges, I have been drawn to programs that offer a strong theoretical foundation combined with hands-on, research-driven approaches. For example, the **Research on Learning and Instruction program at the University of Augsburg** aligns with my interest in understanding how learning environments can be designed to cater to diverse student needs. The program’s interdisciplinary focus on educational psychology, subject matter didactics, and media didactics will equip me with the tools to address the complex challenges of educational inclusivity. Similarly, the **Applied Linguistics program at the University of Bonn** offers a practical focus on solving real-world communication problems, which will be instrumental in helping me develop strategies to make language education more adaptive and inclusive.

As someone who has spent years designing curricula and teaching students with various learning styles, I know firsthand how motivation and emotion can make or break a student's educational experience. For instance, when I worked as the Head of the General English Department at EGE School, I saw how students’ emotional and psychological states affected their ability to engage with the material. I am particularly interested in programs like **English Linguistics at the University of Regensburg**, where I can explore how language structures influence communication and learning. Understanding the cognitive and instructional processes that underlie learning will allow me to design more effective teaching methods that support students not just academically but emotionally as well.

Another program that deeply resonates with my goals is **English Studies at the Chemnitz University of Technology**. This program’s interdisciplinary approach to literature and culture will allow me to examine how language and culture intersect to shape our understanding of the world. Through this lens, I can explore how marginalised communities are represented—or often underrepresented—in educational curricula. By engaging with topics related to British and American studies, I will be able to draw on diverse perspectives that will help me reshape educational content to be more inclusive of different identities and experiences.

Moreover, the **British and American Studies program at Bielefeld University** stands out to me because of its focus on exploring the cultural dimensions of language. This program’s interdisciplinary nature is particularly appealing because it will provide me with the opportunity to study how culture, language, and power dynamics intersect in education. By exploring these themes in depth, I will be better equipped to challenge the traditional norms that dominate educational content in Azerbaijan and create curricula that foster understanding and inclusivity.

In the first part of my studies, I am eager to deepen my understanding of the cognitive, motivational, and emotional processes that shape learning. Developing strategies that acknowledge and support these aspects of learning will be critical as I work toward making education more inclusive. In the second part of my program, I look forward to specialising in fields like instructional processes and motivational psychology, which are directly relevant to the changes I want to bring to my country’s education system. These fields will allow me to explore how educators can foster not just academic success but also emotional well-being and resilience in students—a factor that is often overlooked in traditional educational models.

One of the reasons I am so passionate about these programs is their emphasis on empirical research projects, guided by expert instructors. The opportunity to engage in hands-on research will give me the practical skills to implement changes in educational systems. In Azerbaijan, educational institutions are still largely designed around a one-size-fits-all model, which fails to address the needs of diverse student populations, including LGBTQI+ students and those from rural or underprivileged backgrounds. Through these programs, I hope to gain the knowledge and experience necessary to influence educational policy and practice, making the system more adaptable to different learning strategies and more welcoming to marginalised groups.

One of the most challenging aspects of growing up in a rural area and being part of a marginalised community has been the lack of recognition in the job market. This is a problem that I have encountered both personally and through the experiences of many others. I believe that the root of this issue lies in the educational system, which does not emphasise inclusivity or provide the necessary tools for students from diverse backgrounds to succeed in the workforce. By studying in Germany—a country that values both inclusivity and academic rigour—I hope to bring back strategies and approaches that can reshape education in Azerbaijan. Specifically, the research methods and assessment strategies taught in these programs will be essential for evaluating and improving the inclusivity of our educational institutions.

Germany’s rich history of academic excellence and its commitment to fostering innovation and inclusivity make it the ideal place for me to pursue this degree. The interdisciplinary approaches offered at the University of Augsburg, Chemnitz University of Technology, and Bielefeld University, along with the hands-on focus at the University of Bonn and the University of Regensburg, will provide me with a well-rounded education that integrates theory and practice. I am eager to immerse myself in a collaborative environment where I can contribute to and learn from discussions on how to create learning systems that work for everyone.

In addition to the academic and professional opportunities that these programs provide, I am also excited about the chance to engage with Germany’s diverse culture. Throughout my career, I have always placed a high value on cross-cultural exchange. Whether it was organising language clubs for students from different cultural backgrounds at EGE School or facilitating English classes for underrepresented groups, I have seen firsthand how important it is to foster understanding and dialogue between different communities. I look forward to bringing this passion for inclusivity and diversity to my time in Germany, where I am certain that I will grow both as a student and as a global citizen.

In conclusion, I believe that pursuing a Master’s degree in one of these programs will equip me with the knowledge and skills needed to make a lasting impact on Azerbaijan’s education system. The emphasis on both theory and empirical research, combined with Germany’s strong commitment to inclusivity, makes this an ideal opportunity for me to pursue my academic and professional goals. With the support of a DAAD scholarship, I am confident that I can contribute to the ongoing efforts to make education more equitable and accessible for all students, particularly those from marginalised communities.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to contribute to the academic community in Germany and to use the knowledge and experience I gain to bring about meaningful change in Azerbaijan’s education system.

Sincerely,

**Ruslan Aliyev**
