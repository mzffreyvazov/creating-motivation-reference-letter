I am pleased to write this letter of recommendation for Muzaffar Eyvazov.  I taught Muzaffar in two courses at Azerbaijan State University of Economics, Analytic Geometry and Numerical Methods, and have observed his development as a student and as an emerging professional in the field of computer science. 

Muzaffar was one of the strongest students in my Numerical Methods course, and I would place him in the top 5\% of students I have taught throughout my career. What impressed me about Muzaffar was how he approached the course. Rather than just following lectures, he used his programming skills to work through the material on his own terms. He was the only student who consistently implemented the algorithms we studied in code.  During our ninth lecture on regression methods, he really surprised me by presenting a visualization he had created using Python's Matplotlib library.  Right there in class, he demonstrated how linear regression, inverse linear regression, and quadratic regression models work.  I found it so effective that I began using his visualization in my lectures for other student groups. This kind of initiative, such as creating those visual materials without being asked, is something I rarely see from undergraduates. 

Muzaffar also created mathematical animations for numerical methods algorithms, such as the bisection and Newton-Raphson methods, using the Manim library in Python. When he showed these to me, I was genuinely amazed by how clearly they conveyed concepts that students typically struggle with. This same self-directed approach has defined much of his academic journey. He prepared for university entrance examinations independently, taught himself programming before arriving at university, and achieved an IELTS score of 8.0 through self-study. He even wrote a detailed blog post sharing his preparation methods and materials to help others. In my opinion, they reflect a level of strong discipline and persistence that I believe will serve him well in any demanding academic environment.

Beyond coursework, Muzaffar also volunteered to contribute to my upcoming textbook on Numerical Methods. He took on the task of developing Python implementations for algorithms from the older edition, and he completed this work thoughtfully, with very little supervision from me.  Numerical Methods, he once mentioned, was one of his favorite courses precisely because it connected programming and algorithms with mathematics. His enthusiasm for the subject was obvious, and his classmates benefited from it too. He regularly helped them understand difficult topics, and they found his visualizations particularly useful. 

If there is one area where Muzaffar might continue to develop, it would be in balancing his natural inclination toward building things with deeper engagement in pure mathematical theory.  For instance, he sometimes moved quickly to implementation before fully working through the theoretical derivations on paper.  I see this less as a weakness and more as a reflection of how he learns best, by doing. This hands-on approach has already produced impressive results. 

Muzaffar Eyvazov is one of the most talented and motivated students I have taught. He combines strong analytical ability with curiosity, independence, and genuine enthusiasm for learning.  I recommend him without reservation for your program and I am confident he will make meaningful contributions to any program he joins.
